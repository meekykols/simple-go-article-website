            Go, also known as Golang, is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google.
            It is known for its simplicity and efficiency, making it a popular choice for building scalable
            and concurrent systems.<br>---<br>
            Sometimes there is a need to import packages only for their side effects, without exploiting their use like: import _ “net/ http/ pprof”. This makes it very convenient and useful to code in Go.

        <h2>Web Development with Go</h2>

            Go has a powerful standard library and frameworks like Gorilla Mux for building web applications.
            With its built-in support for concurrency and simplicity, Go is well-suited for building robust and
            efficient web servers.<br>---<br>
            No matter the size of the enterprise – startups or large retail enterprises, software developers use Go in roughly the same way. No need to perform any adjustments.
            <br>---<br>
            Debugging is peculiarly satisfying using modules and cloud services.
